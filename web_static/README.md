I have a command interpreter for managing the AirBnB objects, it’s time to make them alive!

Before developing a big and complex web application, I have build the front end step-by-step.

The first step is to “design” / “sketch” / “prototype” each element:

Create simple HTML static pages
Style guide
Fake contents
No Javascript
No data loaded from anything

During this project, I will learn how to manipulate HTML and CSS languages. HTML is the structure of a web page, it should be the first thing to write. CSS is the styling of the web page, the design.
